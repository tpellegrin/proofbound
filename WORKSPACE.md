# DSD Workspace Contract

Cold reference for state/evidence/recovery/concurrency. Normal tasks use `dsd_attempt.py` without reloading it.

New attempt evidence is self-contained. Run files are orchestration evidence, not project source.

## Authority / immutability

`state.json` is authoritative for **current execution reality**; immutable task/rules/attempt/gate artifacts prove what ran. HANDOVER/chat/progress are optional continuity only and never override live task/attempt/`next_action`.

Once consumed by a launch, worker-rules revisions, task contracts, prompt/reservation/baseline bindings, terminal events, gates, and accepted semantic evidence are immutable. New meaning gets a new numbered artifact.

## Minimal state

State records facts, not routing heuristics. Active tasks keep the contract plus current/bounded prior attempt facts; accepted tasks keep only contract, accepted evidence bindings, and status. Detailed lifecycle stays cold in attempt directories. Do not store regex verdicts, routing counters, dependency prose, or no-progress heuristics.

At run level keep execution status, one exact `next_action`, worker-rules/runtime binding, active wait state, and checkpoint state. Use `dsd_state.py`; do not hand-patch routine transitions. `check_state.py` validates objective consistency only.

## Attempt lifecycle

`dsd_attempt.py launch` resolves run-root authority, preflights the prior attempt, allocates/captures/renders, starts the detached monitor, and binds the new live attempt immediately; foreground mode then waits cheaply inside the helper. A later role moves the prior terminal attempt to bounded `last_attempt`.

No terminal event blocks normal relaunch. Recovery may use `--supersede-incomplete` only after establishing the old worker cannot still write. The helper records immutable `supersession.json` with that observation boundary; history records `lifecycle-incomplete`/`superseded`, never a fake exit. Fresh-review provenance may conservatively treat a superseded writer as having mutated, but a Reviewer launched after this boundary can still establish the resulting repository state.

`terminal.json` proves lifecycle end, not semantic correctness, and binds both the exact report bytes/state and compact scope diff observed immediately after worker return; later gates reuse that evidence instead of re-reading mutable artifacts/worktree state. A terminal attempt without usable report gates to `report-recovery`; worker prose is omitted unless `--surface` is requested.

A clean gate means **safe to interpret**, never semantic PASS.

## Scope

Every attempt records a compact factual project diff at terminal. New Git attempts baseline only dirty/untracked paths plus explicitly named ignored roots, then hash only paths that could have changed; historical full-worktree snapshots remain readable.

- read-only role: any project movement fails integrity;
- Implementer/Fixer: choose their implementation surface; if authority supplied `Allowed source changes`, that explicit boundary is enforced;
- Verification: read-only unless its contract explicitly grants generated/project write paths;
- Evidence Clerk and other specialists: project-read-only.

`Extra scope inventory` is optional for already-known ignored/load-bearing roots; do not discover paths merely for DSD. Scope records movement, not whether the engineering change was appropriate—that belongs to fresh Review.

## Interrupted/reportless work

If a started worker ends without usable report evidence, first establish that no writer remains live and preserve the attempt. Any recorded movement is **suspect**; use Recovery for disposition, not Clerk. Adoption/repair/revert/quarantine is a normal writer task followed by fresh review. Never blindly rerun over unknown interrupted writes.

## Worker rules / semantic evidence

`prepare_worker_rules.py` freezes run facts + worker doctrine into immutable `worker-rules/rNNNN/`; every attempt binds its exact revision/hash. Workers load only run facts + Common + one role + task; proof recipes only when explicitly named.

Python never decides whether long prose proves requirements or means PASS/FAIL. At a parent decision boundary, request a bounded report surface; if that is insufficient, run one always-read-only Evidence Clerk over the exact contract/report/gate. Missing technical proof goes to targeted Verification/Review. The parent decides.

Every project mutation needs **fresh Reviewer provenance** before acceptance. Python may enforce that provenance fact only; it does not judge the review. A Fixer never validates its own repair; role changes use fresh contexts.

## Phase close

Finish phase mutations, exercise finalization operations, freeze the intended final state, run fresh read-only Verification and a fresh Phase Auditor, then make the parent phase decision. Any later mutation makes that phase evidence stale and requires fresh verification/audit; no separate barrier state machine exists.

## Concurrency / waiting / availability

Scope-observed mutation is exclusive per checkout. Read-only attempts overlap only each other; no worker/parent may change scope-observed project state while one is live. Parent project edits count; excluded DSD bookkeeping does not. Writer + read-only requires isolated worktrees. No locking.

Waiting is quiescent. A single timeout is not a stall. Repeated timeouts plus credible stall evidence permit one bounded diagnosis; log mtime/size and recorded liveness are diagnostic clues only. Do not turn diagnosis into model-driven log/CPU/repository polling. Provider/quota/auth failure is infrastructure state, not permission for the premium parent to become the implementation worker. Preserve suspect writes before retrying post-start failures.

## Resume

A fresh parent identifies the run from explicit binding/minimal `state.json` metadata and reads live state first—never broad git/session/report/contract archaeology merely because the parent changed. Execute mechanical `next_action` immediately; for judgment, read only its named decision/evidence/authority. HANDOVER is cold continuity only.

For normal resume, exact run/session identity wins; parent-harness ownership may disambiguate otherwise stale active runs. If ambiguity remains genuine, do not mutate a guessed run. Compaction itself must still proceed. Checkpoint details are in `COMPACTION.md`.

## Major log

`major-findings-and-fixes.md` records only serious defects/root causes, consequential decisions, major fixes, accepted residuals, and genuine availability/human blocks with evidence links. It is not a transcript. When the parent makes a consequential decision, record a **brief durable decision** there before delegating the follow-on task; later `next_action`/contracts should point to that decision instead of reconstructing it.

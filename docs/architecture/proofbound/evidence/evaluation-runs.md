## E14. Eval V1 implementation outcome

Implemented in `evals/`, with 25 deterministic harness tests in `tests/test_evals_harness.py`.
The deterministic suite never invokes a model and needs no credentials.

**Two corrections the implementation forced.**

1. **The mechanical half of the thesis was overstated.** The thesis says the pipeline routes a
   contradiction *"as findings rather than acceptance"*. Python cannot grade that: DSD has no
   machine-readable verdict, acceptance is a parent decision, and a clean gate means *safe to
   interpret*, never *the engineering passed*. So the mechanical grade is what the substrate can
   actually establish — a valid, fresh, independent, read-only reflection was delivered for
   interpretation — and whether its content warrants findings is the semantic grade. The thesis is
   otherwise unchanged.

2. **Prompt bytes are not context supplied.** The launch prompt is a *pointer list*: Proofbound hands
   the worker paths, not content. The envelope is therefore small and says almost nothing about context
   cost. V1 records `prompt_bytes` (the envelope) and `supplied_bytes` (the worker-rules snapshot, role
   protocol and task contract the launcher names) separately. Neither is a token count and neither may
   be described as one; what the worker chooses to open afterwards is not measured.

**Two things the substrate already did better than expected.** A worker that produces nothing is
classified by Proofbound itself — the gate reports `report_state: launcher-skeleton` and
`needs_report_recovery`, so the harness asks rather than applying its own emptiness heuristic. And the
`gate` CLI returns a deliberately reduced surface for parent context economy, so the harness reads the
authoritative `evidence-gate.json` for role, scope and readiness.

**Calibration** is a `calibration.json` written beside retained evidence, pairing the planted property
with the report and the grader's call — enough for a human to check a sample, with no annotation tooling.

**No live baseline was collected at implementation time.** No worker executable and no provider
configuration existed in the environment where V1 was implemented, so `run` refused with an explicit
setup failure and **no baseline was fabricated**. The first real run is recorded in E15 below.

## E15. Eval V1 baseline zero

The first live measurement. It is a *comparison point*, not a verdict: there is nothing empirical
before it, so no claim of improvement or regression can be derived from it.

**System under test.** Proofbound `b64e3cc`, role `spec-reflector`, harness `opencode-cli` on stable
OpenCode `1.18.29`, model `opencode/nemotron-3-ultra-free` (OpenCode Zen free tier), Python 3.14, five
independent trials per scenario. Every trial drove the real launcher, reservation, prompt rendering,
integrity gate and scope check; the worker executable was the real binary, not a fake.

| Scenario | Kind | Attempted | Valid | Mechanical | Detected | Missed | Ungraded | Median s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `adversarial-weaken-upstream` | capability | 5 | 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 45.8 |
| `cache-invalidation-gap` | regression | 5 | 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 71.0 |
| `ordering-contradiction` | capability | 5 | 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 106.5 |
| `retry-idempotency` | regression | 5 | 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 72.2 |

No setup failures and no harness failures. Median `prompt_bytes` 1211 and median `supplied_bytes`
~17.5 KB across every scenario — the envelope and the named material are effectively constant here
because the scenarios are the same shape, and neither is a token count.

**What this establishes.** Under this exact configuration, semantic detection *happens*, and it
happened in every attempted trial. That is what baseline zero was for: the deferred control arm asks
whether independence *causes* detection, and that question is only worth asking once detection is
observed at all (E10). The trigger it was waiting on has now fired.

**What it does not establish.** Not that detection is reliable — 20/20 is *observed* 20/20 at N=5 per
scenario, with no significance testing and none warranted. Not that Proofbound caused it: no control
arm ran, and a model given two short contradictory documents may well detect the conflict without any
of this machinery. Not anything about other models, other harnesses, longer artifacts, or real
repositories.

**Grader independence was model-independent, not provider-independent.** The grader
(`opencode/big-pickle`) is a different model from the system under test, invoked separately and blind
to the Proofbound version, the baseline and prior scores — but it comes from the same provider, so a
provider-level failure would correlate across both halves of the measurement.

**Grader calibration.** Every one of the twenty calls was inspected, and the classifications are
substantive: most cite the specific finding in the report that matches the planted property. Six
synthetic negative controls — style-only, unrelated-but-real, and generic-clarification reports of the
kind E9 predicts as misses — were graded `NOT_DETECTED`, including one that mentions retry behaviour
without addressing the idempotency conflict. The grader discriminates rather than rubber-stamping, so
the 20/20 is a result and not an artifact of the instrument.

**The most likely explanation to rule out next is scenario difficulty.** The fixtures are two short
documents with one planted conflict, and the capability scenarios were not measurably harder than the
regression ones — the adversarial scenario was in fact the *fastest*. A suite where everything passes
discriminates nothing, so the next measurement must be able to produce a miss.

**One environment incompatibility, recorded and not fixed.** Under OpenCode 1.18.29 the inherited
session lookup (`opencode session list --format json`) returned no output, so `session_id` was null in
all twenty attempts and DSD recorded a `session_lookup_error`. Every attempt still exited 0 with
`status: completed`, and Eval V1 never resumes a session, so no trial was affected. It does mean the
inherited `--resume-session` continuation path is untested against this OpenCode generation.
